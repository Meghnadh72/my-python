"""
Turing Problem : 
Given a list of real numbers (negative,0, postive).
What will be the min cost to make the array contain first N natural 
numbers, n being size of array

Note: You can either increase or decrease a element by ONE, and the 
cost of that operation would be 1. 
input = [3,4,1,-9,0,5,3]
output should calculate min cost so 
that array contains all N natural 
numbers till 7, n being size of array.
