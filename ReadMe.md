# Regarding Data Types 
##  Some Data Types are considered as sequences - meaning they are
1) Ordered
2) Indexed
3) Has a Length

Tuple, Lists, Strings are considered as Sequences

## Some Data Types are considered as containers - meaning they can
1) Store Multiple Objects 
2) Modify them
3) Access them

Lists - Ordered, Dictionaries - Unordered, Sets - Unordered unique items

Note: Tuple can store but can't modify (immutability) hence not containers
